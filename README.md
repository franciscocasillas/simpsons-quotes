Add any quote from The Simpsons but beware of Mr. Burns, he's trying to remove Homer off the map. Why don't we remove him instead? Try the live app in <a href="https://the-simpsons.onrender.com">here</a>.

# Project description
## Technologies used
This project was built using <b>HTML</b>, <b>EJS</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express.js</b>. <a href="https://www.mongodb.comMongoDB">MongoDB</a> was used to store the database, and <a href="https://render.com">Render</a> was used to deploy the app. 

## Project goals
- Create a simple CRUD app that uses the four basic methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Store information inside a NoSQL remote atabase. 
- Deploy the app to a remote server.

# Lessons learned
1. **Manage your IP address permissions** One of the  main things I learned from building a CRUD app is that IP permissions are very important to be able to interact with the API. Modules like CORS and permissions inside of MongoDB for IP addresses were one of my main problems while trying to build the app, but applying and managing them is actually easy once you understand them.
2. **Create your own documentation for future projects.** Connecting to the MongoDB database was a little complicated at first. Of course, once you figure it out, you don't really know why you had so much trouble to begin with. Building your own manuals and tutorials is very useful to understand, but also to have something to help you out when building a new application. 

## Optimizations
- [ ] Add styling.
- [ ] Allow Mr. Burns to attack other characters aside from Homer.
